Human Tracking and Identification in Real Room Acoustics

Welcome to a project  for Human Tracking and Identification in Real Room Acoustics! This repository contains  models aimed at locating and identifying humans based on room impulse responses (RIR).

Overview
In many real-world scenarios, such as smart home applications, security systems, and human-computer interaction, the ability to track and identify humans in a room based on acoustic signals is crucial. This dataset provides the necessary resources to tackle this task, focusing on the analysis of room impulse responses.
